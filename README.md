- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Philmist, Japanese hobby programmer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in something useful for me to broadcast with peercast.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, powershell(pwsh), javascript(client-side), etc...
- ðŸ“« I rarely see github's notification and mail. If you need to contact me, use twitter(@philmist).
